# First-JavaScript-Programs
## Fall 2019 - Spring 2020
Some of my very first few JavaScript programs when I was learning in highschool that I look back on fondly. Very rudementary uses of mathematic operations, if/else statements, and prompts.

Based on guidelines given in class (some topics are very random), but I was encouraged to use my imagination, research new functions and techniques, and add as much as I wanted, so the programs ended up being above and beyond what was neccessary.

My personal favorite is WhaleTranslator.js. It was a very goofy introduction to sentence parsing, but really captures the simple joys of learning to code!
